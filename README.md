# Iris Data Visualization with ggplot2

This project demonstrates how to use the `ggplot2` library in R to analyze and visualize the famous Iris dataset. It includes five different types of plots to explore the relationships between petal and sepal measurements across three species of flowers.

## Files Included

- `Iris.csv`: Dataset used in the analysis
- `iris_analysis.R`: R script that generates all plots and saves them to the `plots/` folder
- `informe.txt`: Project summary in Spanish
- `Iris_Ggplot2_Report.Rproj`: RStudio project file
- `plots/`: Folder containing generated PNG graphs

## How to Use

1. Open `Iris_Ggplot2_Report.Rproj` in RStudio
2. Run `iris_analysis.R`
3. The graphs will be saved to the `plots/` folder automatically
